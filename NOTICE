This ComfyUI node pack wraps and adapts code from the Stream-DiffVSR
repository for integration with ComfyUI. The following components are
derived from or inspired by the upstream implementation:

- Pipeline architecture and inference logic
- ARTG (Auto-Regressive Temporal Guidance) module integration
- Temporal-aware VAE decoder with TPM
- 4-step DDIM scheduler configuration
- Optical flow warping utilities

Modifications from upstream:
- Adapted for ComfyUI node interface
- Added state management for chunked video processing
- Implemented temporal-aware tiling for memory efficiency
- Added ComfyUI-specific tensor format conversions (BHWC <-> BCHW)
